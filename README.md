**Archetecture**

In my full-stack project, I used both traditional frontend development tools like Express HTML and JavaScript, along with a more modern approach with Single-Page Applications (SPA). Traditional frontend development involves creating separate pages that are reloaded with each interaction. HTML is used for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for handling dynamic elements and user interactions. In contrast, an SPA focuses on delivering a seamless experience by loading a single HTML page and dynamically updating the content as the user interacts with the app, without requiring page reloads. This is typically achieved using JavaScript frameworks like Angular, which efficiently manage the DOM and handle routing on the client side. SPAs improve user experience by making the application feel faster and more responsive, but they can also increase complexity in terms of routing and state management.

The backend of the project used a NoSQL MongoDB database because it offers flexibility and scalability, which are important for modern web applications. Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents, making it easier to handle data that is unstructured or changes frequently. In my project, this was particularly useful as the data had varying structures and was often updated in real-time, a scenario where NoSQL databases excel. Additionally, MongoDB integrates well with Node.js (used with Express in the backend), enabling fast development with JavaScript on both the frontend and backend. This setup allowed for easier scaling and more efficient handling of large amounts of data, especially when dealing with user profiles, interactions, and logs that require quick reads and writes.

**Functionality**

JSON is a lightweight, text-based data format that is used for storing and exchanging data, whereas JavaScript is a programming language that is used to create interactive and dynamic web pages. JSON is specifically designed to be easily readable and writable by both humans and machines, and it represents data in a simple key-value pair structure. While JSON itself is not a programming language, it is based on the syntax of JavaScript objects, which makes it easy to use within JavaScript applications. The primary difference lies in that JavaScript is used for logic and behavior, whereas JSON is used purely for data representation. JSON acts as a bridge to transfer data between the frontend and backend by being sent over HTTP requests, typically through APIs, while JavaScript is used to handle and process that data on the client side (frontend) and server side (backend).

One example of where I refactored code to improve functionality is taking some of the static HTML pages and replacing them with templates using handlebars.  Allowing for the structure of the page to be reused and having the ability for it to change the content displayed. Another instance is moving the content used for showing the templates out if static JSON files within the code into MongoDB which allows for data to be added or changed withing having to make code changes to the website. 

**Testing**

In a full-stack application, methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) define the type of action the client wants the server to perform, while endpoints are the specific URLs through which these requests are made. Security is crucial, involving practices like authentication (verifying the user's identity) and authorization (ensuring users have appropriate permissions), often implemented with JWT or OAuth. Additionally, input validation, CORS, and HTTPS ensure data integrity and protection from malicious attacks. API testing ensures endpoints function correctly and securely, verifying proper data handling and access control.

**Reflection**

Overall this course helped me understnd how websites are built. This could help me in my future career by giving me the knowledge base on developing a page that can be used as anvertisement or and landing page for any gameing company I will be working for since my goal is to work with video game development. These can also help me clean up my own code a bit
